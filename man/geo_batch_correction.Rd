\usage{
geo_batch_correction(mergedset, batch, design, idtype)
}
\arguments{
\item{mergedset}{A large Expression Set. The output of the function
`geo_merge`. Please note, that mergedset holds data, which are not
yet batch corrected.}

\item{batch}{Takes the results from \code{create_batch()} as input.}

\item{design}{A two-column matrix. Holds information on the studie's
target variable and is created by `stats::model.matrix(~ diagnosis)`.}

\item{idtype}{A character string. The type of ID used to name the
genes. One of 'entrez' or 'affy' intended to use either entrez IDs or
affy IDs. Caution: when using entrez IDs, missing and duplicated IDs
are being removed!}

\description{
Helper function correcting for batch effects and mapping
  affy probes to Entrez IDs
}
\details{
This function takes a Bioconductor's ExpressionSet class (the
  output of the function `geo_merge`) and outputs a batch corrected
  matrix containing expression data. In order to correct for occurring
  batch effects and other unwanted variation in high-throughput
  experiments the `ComBat` function from the sva package is conducted.
  The affy probes are mapped to their Entrez IDs. Thereby, empty and
  replicated character strings are removed.
